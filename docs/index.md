# shr-lux project notebook

A standalone zk notebook of linked Markdown notes. Keep observed facts, protocol
references, proposals, decisions and test results distinguishable. Sources were consulted
on 2026-09-28 unless another date is stated. The original [idea](../idea.md) remains intact.

## Using zk

From the project root:

```sh
zk --notebook-dir docs index
zk --notebook-dir docs list
zk --notebook-dir docs list --match udmx
zk --notebook-dir docs new docs/notes --title "Fixture test observations"
```

Or `cd docs` and use zk normally. This nested notebook is deliberately independent of
any parent notebook. Regular `.md` links also work on GitHub and without zk installed.
The generated index database is ignored; notes, config and template are versioned.
New notes should link to related notes and be added here. Never turn an untested
assumption into a hardware fact. Keep large recordings and private venue details in
ignored local storage; add only the small evidence needed to explain a result.

zk may warn that links to the root idea.md are outside this notebook; those links
are intentional and resolve normally in Markdown.
